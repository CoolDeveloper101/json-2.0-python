# json-2.0-python
This is a wrapper around the *json* module, which uses *pickle* to store a wide variety of objects.

Json is a nice format, but it does not let you store a custom data type.
This module lets you store custom objects, which can be used in a wide variety of tasks.
For example, you cannot store a numpy array using json but using this module, you can.
